Have you ever seen multiplication represented with * instead of x? Well in Python we use the star symbol * for multiplication.<br>
So it should not surprise you if I said that 2 * 3 = 6. But what about "Pizza" * 6? <br>
<br>
If your guess was a lot of Pizza then you are correct! It would give us a string that looks like "PizzaPizzaPizzaPizzaPizzaPizza".
