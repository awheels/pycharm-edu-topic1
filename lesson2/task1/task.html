Sometimes we want to include quotes inside strings, such as when we want to show sarcasm. Can you think of any problems<br>
that you could encounter?<br>
<br>
Copy and paste the statement below and then run it:<br>
<b>print("Mr. Wheeler has "great" hair.")</b><br>
<br>
This should give you an error message. Fix the bug in the code and get it to print the correct statement.
