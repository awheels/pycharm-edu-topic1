Strings have special abilities called 'string methods'. For example, strings have a built in method
'upper()' that makes the string uppercase. <br>
<br>
How is a method different from a built-in function, like input() or print()? Well, a built-in function can be called
all on its own, while a string method must be called on a specific string.<br>
<br>
You call method on a string by adding a dot followed by the name of the method.
